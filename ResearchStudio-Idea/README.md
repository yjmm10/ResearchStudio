> From a research problem to a reviewer-defensible idea card — Automating the First Mile of Research Ideation.

**ResearchStudio - Idea** streamlines the *first* steps of a research project — the thinking that has to happen *before* any writing. Drop in a research problem and **IdeaSpark** runs the full pipeline end-to-end — read the field → find the bottleneck → choose the ideation pattern → draft the idea → check prior art → audit & revise → render the card — and hands back one reviewer-defensible, **implementable** idea card. Every step is grounded in a 1,947-paper ICLR / ICML / NeurIPS corpus (2021–2025) and its induced taxonomy of **15 ideation patterns** and **31 sub-patterns** — and **faithful by construction**: every load-bearing claim either traces to a retrieved record or is flagged as model-supplied.

## The skills

Three skills compose into one research-ideation loop — **search → generate → review** — with **IdeaSpark** the end-to-end flagship and the other two usable standalone:

| Skill | Input | Output | Built for |
|---|---|---|---|
| [**Idea-Spark**](skills/idea_spark/SKILL.md)| A research problem / direction (optional constraints, seed papers, compute) | one reviewer-defensible, implementable idea card — Title · Motivation · Method, as Markdown + PDF | the **full research-problem → idea-card pipeline**, calibrated against Oral-accepted papers |
| [**Paper-Search**](skills/paper_search/SKILL.md) | A query + year range (optional venues) | a deduped paper list across arXiv / DBLP / OpenAlex / OpenReview / Semantic Scholar / Crossref / DeepXiv / Sciverse | the literature-grounding building block, usable on its own |
| [**Scoop-Check**](skills/scoop_check/SKILL.md) | A problem statement + a claimed novelty | a prior-art collision verdict: an overlap level + the closest prior works, per axis | a standalone "has this been done?" prior-art check on one novelty claim |

## Usage

Ask your agent in natural language — it picks up the matching skill and runs it end-to-end. Examples use Claude Code; other backends are in [docs/USAGE.md](https://github.com/ai-nuts/Storage/blob/main/ResearchStudio/ResearchStudio-Idea/docs/USAGE.md).

### 💡 IdeaSpark

```text
> /idea-spark I want a novel ML research idea about physical realism in text-to-video models.
```

One research direction → one reviewer-defensible idea card (Title · Motivation · Method), returned inline with PDF + LaTeX side artifacts.

**Example output** — three ideas IdeaSpark generated for ICLR-2026-Oral problem seeds, rendered as lean cards (Title · Motivation · Method). Click a card for the full PDF.

### 🔍 Paper-Search

```text
> /paper-search KV cache compression for long-context LLMs, 2024–2026
```

Returns a deduped paper list across arXiv / DBLP / OpenAlex / OpenReview / Semantic Scholar / Crossref / DeepXiv / Sciverse.

### 🛡️ Scoop-Check

```text
> /scoop-check Problem: efficient LLM inference. Novelty: a calibrated per-token
  early-exit stop rule read from the model's own layer-wise prediction trajectory.
```

Returns a per-axis overlap verdict against the closest published work. Input: a **research problem + the claimed novelty** — or just paste an idea card (it reads them from Motivation + Method).

## Evaluation

On 100 ICLR-2026-Oral problem seeds, each IdeaSpark idea card is scored on **quality** (the `idea-quality` skill) and **novelty** (`scoop-check`) against three baselines — Opus-4.8 (bare), Opus-4.8 (self-gen), and GPT-5.5 (bare). IdeaSpark lands top — the highest idea-quality while staying solidly novel — and scores highest in **every research domain**.
