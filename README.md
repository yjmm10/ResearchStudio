ResearchStudio is a collection of skills covering the **entire research lifecycle** — from the moment you have a vague research direction to the moment your paper goes public.
These skills are supported by [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) and [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex).

## News🔥🔥🔥

- [**Preview**] **[ResearchStudio-Reel](ResearchStudio-Reel/) is coming soon** — the *post-paper* half: turn a finished paper PDF into the artifacts a publication needs — a print-ready poster, a narrated walkthrough video, a bilingual blog post, and an interactive reel viewer.
- [**2026-07-03**] **[ResearchStudio-Idea](ResearchStudio-Idea/) is released** — the *pre-paper* half: turn an under-specified research direction into a reviewer-defensible, implementable idea, grounded in an empirical taxonomy induced from a large-scale papers of ICLR / ICML / NeurIPS submissions.


## Quick Start

**Option 1 — clone and run `install.sh`** (symlinks the skills from a local clone and scaffolds `.env`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ResearchStudio.git && cd ResearchStudio
bash install.sh
```

**Option 2 — interactive `npx` installer** (choose which plugins to install, enter your API keys when prompted, and it writes `.env` for you):

```bash
npx github:microsoft/ResearchStudio
```

We recommend utilizing these skills with models versions $\ge$ `claude-opus-4.6` and `gpt-5.5`.
